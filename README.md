# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for authentication and other services. The Firebase configuration uses environment variables with fallback defaults for CI/CD builds.

### Local Development

For local development with real Firebase services, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

You'll also need to:
1. Download `google-services.json` from your Firebase project console and place it in the root directory.
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your Firebase project console and place it in `ios/financialmanagement/`.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline works out-of-the-box without requiring any secrets configuration. It uses:
- Default/dummy Firebase configuration values for successful builds
- Automatically generated dummy Firebase config files during the build process

**Optional:** If you want to use real Firebase services in CI (for integration tests), you can still set up GitHub Secrets with your actual Firebase configuration values.

**Note:** The Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`) are not committed to the repository for security reasons.
